Ripauto Memo
====

[日本語はこちら](readme_jp.md)

## Overview
It is a database management system that you met friends in VRChat.

## Description
This is a imitation of the notebook that VRChat user [りぱうと（ripauto）](https://vrchat.com/home/user/usr_990e1d41-3fdb-49ae-a3a0-16b145cb7c02) uses on a regular basis. Sometimes, they remember friend by the notebook that they met friends, for example date, name and simple memo. 

Are there situations when you meet a lot of people and you forget when/where/who/what you did and have trouble having a conversation? In fact, I met the person with the yellow nameplate and we both asked each other, "Where did we meet?" and we soon parted ways. "Is there anyone like that?"　You have a wonderful memory! ;->

Hopefully, the conversation between you and friends will last forever.
